# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the site" or "we")! Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our site, you're pretty much saying "I agree" and accepting these terms. 😉

## 1. Our Services at a Glance
The site offers users awesome paid subscription content and membership services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions, among others. Just a heads-up, some content is only available for our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To register for an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Pretty standard stuff!
- Account holders are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account. It's yours alone!
- If users ever violate these terms, the site reserves the right to **suspend or even terminate** their account. Don't say we didn't warn ya!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- Payments are processed securely via third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the site itself never stores your payment info. We've got your back!
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends. So, keep an eye on that!
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy:** If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're requesting the refund. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. Beyond 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law absolutely says we have to. Just being upfront!

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the site (hubtoday)**. Seriously, don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right** to access this content for personal learning and reading. Think of it as your personal library card!
- For any commercial use or if you want to quote extensively, please reach out to the site to get authorization first. Thanks!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Users are absolutely **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice, folks!
- Also, it's a big **no-no** to use technical means to mass-download, scrape, or hack our member content. That's just not cool.
- The site has every right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any violating users**. We mean business here!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up!
- If, by some chance, content becomes temporarily unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances like force majeure, server issues, or third-party service outages, the site will **not be liable for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it happens!

## 7. Disclaimer
- The info provided on the site is purely for reference. It **does not constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, medical, you name it!).
- The site is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. So, please use your best judgment!

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Standard legal stuff here!
- Any disputes arising out of or related to these terms? Both parties agree to first try and resolve them amicably. If that doesn't work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 😉
