# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

---

This Privacy Policy spills the beans on how we collect, use, and dish out your info when you're using our Service. It also clues you in on your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We totally use your personal data to power up and boost our Service. By hopping onto the Service, you're giving us the green light to collect and use your info just as this Privacy Policy lays out.

## Interpretations and Definitions

### Interpretations
Capitalized words get their meanings defined right here, under the conditions below. And guess what? These definitions rock the same meaning whether they're singular or plural.

### Definitions
For this Privacy Policy, here's what those terms mean:

- **Account:** Your unique digital spot to hop onto our Service (or parts of it!).
- **Affiliate:** Think of it as a buddy company! It's an entity that calls the shots for another, is bossed around by another, or hangs out under the same boss. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the voting power for electing directors or similar bigwigs.
- **Company:** (You'll see us as "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this doc!) That's us: **hubtoday**.
- **Cookies:** These are tiny files websites stash on your computer, phone, or gadget. They pack details like your browsing history on that site, plus a bunch of other handy stuff.
- **Country:** We're talking California, USA! 🌴
- **Device:** Any gizmo that can get you onto the Service – a computer, a mobile phone, or even your digital tablet.
- **Personal Data:** Any info that's about someone who's already identified or can totally be identified.
- **Service:** This refers to our awesome Website.
- **Service Provider:** This is any person or company that crunches data for us. They're the third-party pros we hire to help run the Service, do stuff related to it, or help us figure out how folks are using it.
- **Usage Data:** Automatically collected info, like what's generated by using the Service or its infrastructure itself (think how long you chill on a page).
- **Website:** That's **hubtoday**, which you can find rockin' at `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.
- **You:** That's *you*! The individual or the company/legal eagle accessing or using our Service.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data We Collect

#### Personal Data
Personal Data is what we might ask you for when you're using our Service – stuff that can help us get in touch or identify you. This juicy info could include, but isn't limited to:
- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's the stuff we automatically collect when you're rocking the Service.

Your Usage Data might spill details like your device's Internet Protocol address (yep, your IP address! 🕵️‍♀️), what browser you're using (and its version), which pages on our Service you're checking out, when you visited (time and date), how long you hung around, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic info.

If you're hitting up the Service on a mobile device, we might automatically grab some extra deets. This could include your mobile device type, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile OS, the kind of mobile browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and, you guessed it, more diagnostic data! 📱

Whether you're visiting our Service or cruising it on your mobile, we also snag info that your browser sends our way.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
Cookies and other tracking technologies are what we use to keep tabs on activity on our Service and stash away some info. We're talking beacons, tags, and scripts – all designed to gather and track data, helping us fine-tune and analyze our Service. Here's a peek at what we might be using:

- **Cookies (or Browser Cookies)**: These are tiny files that land on your device. You've got the power to tell your browser to ditch all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But a heads-up: if you don't play nice with Cookies, some cool parts of our Service might not work for you. Unless your browser's set to flat-out reject them, our Service will likely be using Cookies. 🍪
- **Web Beacons**: These are those tiny electronic files you might spot in some parts of our Service and emails (they also go by clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). They're pretty neat, letting us, for example, count how many users visited a page or opened an email, and help with other website stats (like seeing how popular a section is or just making sure our systems are all good).

Persistent or Session Cookies: That's the two main flavors of cookies! Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or mobile device even after you've gone offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We totally use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the reasons we're about to lay out below:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These cookies are crucial for giving you access to the services available through the Website and letting you use its awesome features. They're like bouncers for user verification and stopping sneaky, fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these, the services you ask for just wouldn't happen, and we only use 'em to deliver those services to you.
- **Cookies Policy / Notification Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These cookies are all about checking if you've given the green light to use cookies on the Website. ✅
- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These cookies are super handy because they let us remember choices you've made while using the Website – like keeping you logged in or recalling your language preferences. The whole point? To give you a more personalized experience, so you don't have to re-enter your preferences every single time you visit.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
Personal Data? The Company might use it for these cool reasons:

- **For providing and keeping our Service in tip-top shape**, which includes watching how our Service is used.
- **For managing Your Account**: We'll use it to handle your registration as a Service user. That Personal Data you share lets you tap into all sorts of awesome features available only to registered users.
- **For hitting those contract goals**: This means developing, sticking to, and totally nailing the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've snagged, or any other contracts you ink with us via the Service.
- **For keeping in touch with You**: We might ping you via email, calls, texts, or other digital high-fives (like push notifications from our mobile app! 📲) with updates or info about features, products, or services you've signed up for – including security updates, when it's smart or necessary.
- **For sending you the good stuff**: Think news, special deals, and general info about other cool goods, services, and events we've got brewing that are similar to what you've already checked out or bought – unless you've told us you're not into that.
- **For handling your requests**: We're all about processing and managing anything you send our way.
- **For business moves**: If we're ever looking at a merger, sale, or shaking things up with our assets (whether we're still running or in a bankruptcy sitch), we might use your info to scope out or handle that transfer. Your Personal Data, as one of our Service user assets, could be part of the deal.
- **For other neat purposes**: We might also use your info for things like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually working, and generally boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. ✨

Your personal info? Here are the times we might share it:

- **With Service Providers**: We might team up with Service Providers and share your personal info with them to keep an eye on Service usage and get in touch with you.
- **For Business Transfers**: In the middle of a merger, selling off Company assets, getting financing, or another company buying us out (partially or wholly), we might share or transfer your personal info during those talks or the actual deal.
- **With Affiliates**: Your info might get shared with our affiliates, but don't sweat it – we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! Affiliates are like our parent company, any sister companies, joint venture pals, or other companies we control or that are under the same umbrella as us.
- **With Business Partners**: We could share your info with our business partners if it means hooking you up with certain products, services, or sweet promotions.
- **With Other Users**: If you're sharing personal info or just chatting it up in the public areas of the Service with other users, well, everyone else might see it, and it could even be shared publicly outside. So, share wisely! 🗣️
- **With Your Consent**: We might spill your personal info for any other reason, but only if you give us the thumbs-up first. 👍

### Retaining Your Personal Data
Your Personal Data? The Company only holds onto it for as long as we need it for the purposes we've laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your Personal Data if it's necessary to stick to our legal duties (like if the law says we gotta keep it ⚖️), sort out any disputes, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed.

Usage Data also gets kept by the Company for our own internal analysis. This kind of data usually sticks around for a shorter stint, unless we're using it to beef up our Service's security, make it work better, or if we're legally on the hook to keep it longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Your information, including your Personal Data, gets processed right here at the Company's offices and wherever our processing partners are chilling. This totally means your info might zip over to and be stored on computers outside your state, province, country, or even other governmental areas – places where data protection laws might be a bit different from your neck of the woods. 🌍

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and then sending us your info, you're basically giving us the green light for that transfer. ✅

The Company is committed to taking all reasonable steps to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't be sending your Personal Data off to any organization or country unless we've got solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info. No compromises! 🔒

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You totally have the right to ditch your Personal Data or ask us to give you a hand in deleting the info we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let *you* delete some of your info right from inside the Service itself. Pretty cool, huh?

Want to update, change, or delete your info? Just log into your Account (if you've got one!) and head to the account settings where you can manage your personal deets. Or, you can just hit us up directly to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads-up, though: we might need to hang onto some info if we have a legal obligation or a valid reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
Business transactions like a merger, acquisition, or asset sale could mean your Personal Data gets transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy. 🤝

#### Law Enforcement
Law enforcement might come calling! 👮‍♀️ In certain situations, the Company could be asked to spill your Personal Data if it's legally required or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request.

#### Other Legal Requirements
Other legal requirements might also mean the Company has to disclose your Personal Data. We might do this if we genuinely believe such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Your Personal Data's security is a big deal to us, no doubt! 🛡️ But here's the real talk: no method of sending stuff over the internet or storing it electronically is *ever* 100% bulletproof. We seriously try our best using all the commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, but we can't promise it's absolutely, totally, completely secure.

## Children's Privacy
Children's privacy is super important, so our Service isn't aimed at anyone under 13. We definitely don't knowingly collect personal info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and realize your little one has given us Personal Data, please get in touch! If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without a verified parental nod, we'll quickly boot that info from our servers. 🧒🚫

Parental consent might also be needed: if we gotta rely on consent to process your info and your country says a parent's got to sign off, then we might ask for that parental thumbs-up before we collect and use that information.

## Links to Other Websites
Links to other websites might pop up in our Service – but hey, those aren't run by us! If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend you take a peek at the Privacy Policy of *every* site you visit. 👀

Third-party sites or services? We've got zero control over their content, privacy policies, or practices, and we can't take responsibility for 'em. Just sayin'.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
Changes to this Privacy Policy? Yep, we might update it now and then! We'll totally let you know about any tweaks by posting the shiny new Privacy Policy right here on this page. ✨

We'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service *before* any changes actually kick in. Plus, we'll make sure to update that "Last Updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

So, what's our advice? Check this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Any tweaks to this Privacy Policy become official the moment they hit this page.
